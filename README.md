# Final Project 📊👨‍💼💻💬

Your team will utilize MERN to create a useful small web application. You can utilize open-source CSS but it must be cited.

## Part 1 - Requirements

See specification on Canvas.

The same requirements apply:

* Validated your html (at least what it generates) and have included metadata like in previous assignments.
* Test for contrast with a11y.
* Modified the documentation in the program's comments (for the files you edited) to describe the changes you made. Verify that you are well documenting your code using [JSDoc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdoc) standards. You do not need to generate an API.
* Ensured that you write satisfactory unit tests and that your code passes them, with **75%** coverage, but the code you wrote needs to be completely covered. Testing must include mocking.
* Sanatize your database inputs

## Part 2 - Reflection

Update the README to answer the following questions:

 1. Add screenshots showing your app running on Google Cloud. Add a link to your website. Add a screenshot showing the html on your website has been validated. Also one showing proper contrast.
 2. Add screenshots showing your Atlas database before and after your app runs.
 3. Each person: Describe your experience working with your team to complete this project. What is one key learning that you're taking away from this experience? What is one thing that you would change?
 4. Explain what parts each team member did. Keep in mind we can see your GitHub commit history.
 5. Each person: What was the process like working on this full-stack web application. Provide specific examples to help illustrate your experience.
