# Final Project üìäüë®‚Äçüíºüíªüí¨

Your team will utilize MERN to create a useful small web application. You can utilize open-source CSS but it must be cited.

## Part 1 - Requirements

See specification on Canvas.

The same requirements apply:

* Validated your html (at least what it generates) and have included metadata like in previous assignments.
* Test for contrast with a11y.
* Modified the documentation in the program's comments (for the files you edited) to describe the changes you made. Verify that you are well documenting your code using [JSDoc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdoc) standards. You do not need to generate an API.
* Ensured that you write satisfactory unit tests and that your code passes them, with **75%** coverage, but the code you wrote needs to be completely covered. Testing must include mocking.
* Sanatize your database inputs

## Part 2 - Reflection

Update the README to answer the following questions:

 1. Add screenshots showing your app running on Google Cloud. Add a link to your website. Add a screenshot showing the html on your website has been validated. Also one showing proper contrast.
 2. Add screenshots showing your Atlas database before and after your app runs.
 3. Each person: Describe your experience working with your team to complete this project. What is one key learning that you're taking away from this experience? What is one thing that you would change?<br>
  Kyra Lu: It was a comprehensive and collaborative experience for me. One key learning from this experience is likely the importance of integrating front-end and back-end systems effectively. Handling both the user interface aspects and the back-end logic requires a deep understanding of how these elements interact. Ensuring a seamless user experience while maintaining data security and integrity is a critical skill in software development. <br>If there's something to change or improve upon, it might involve further enhancing the collaborative aspects of the project. There is still some code conflicts even we seperated the work clearly, which may result in some waste of time and repeated work. But overall, I think we did a pretty good job.

  Zhuoxi Wang:Working on our web project as the front-end data display lead was both challenging and rewarding. Collaborating closely with my teammates, I learned the importance of effective communication and timely feedback. Our team's diverse skills and perspectives contributed significantly to the project's success.One key learning from this experience is the value of iterative development. Regularly updating and refining the front-end based on back-end progress and user feedback helped us create a more user-friendly and efficient interface. This iterative approach ensured that we were always moving in the right direction and adapting to changes swiftly.If I could change one aspect of our project, it would be to incorporate more user testing in the early stages. Initially, we focused heavily on technical aspects and functionalities, but integrating user feedback earlier would have provided valuable insights and potentially saved time during later stages of development.Overall, this project was a great opportunity to enhance my technical skills and learn the importance of balancing user needs with technical feasibility.

 4. Explain what parts each team member did. Keep in mind we can see your GitHub commit history.<br>
    Jialin: Team Management and Data Integration<br>
    Kyra: User Management and Team Interaction<br>
    Zhuoxi: Data Display
7. Each person: What was the process like working on this full-stack web application. Provide specific examples to help illustrate your experience.<br>
   Kyra Lu: Working on the Leecopal full-stack web application was a multifaceted process, starting with project planning and requirements gathering. We identified key features like team Management, data integration and display as well as registration, login, and a question-answer system. The next phase involved designing the website wireframe. Then designing the database schema for different user accounts, groups and question-answers, creating user-friendly interfaces. Afterwards, we all worked on our side of the project. And in the end, we conducted functionality and  code tests to ensure the operation of the whole project. During the entire process, we also did discussion and communication on a regular basis, which ensures the smooth work of the entire team.

   Zhuoxi Wang:Working on this full-stack web application, where my primary task was to visualize our team's LeetCode practice data, was both intricate and enlightening. I developed a system to fetch each member's LeetCode activity, then used technologies like JavaScript and charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js) to display individual and collective problem-solving trends. For instance, I created interactive line graphs showing each member's daily problem count over time, highlighting trends and active periods. Additionally, I designed an aggregate dashboard to compare activity levels, effectively identifying the most engaged members. This project honed my skills in data handling, visualization, and creating intuitive, user-friendly interfaces. It was a comprehensive experience, blending backend data integration with meaningful front-end presentations.
